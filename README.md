This is a weather website which renders the weather details and future 5 days forecast details just by entering the name of a city.
I Have used multiple weather related API's to get the different sorts of data to complete this project.
There is also a link of this website also which i have published through github pages 
and the link is right here => https://vedantbohra.github.io/ClimateCast/
